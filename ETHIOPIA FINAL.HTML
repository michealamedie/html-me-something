					<h><b>AFAR</b></h>
					<p>Positioned on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the Danakil Depression. It’s officially one of driest and hottest places on Earth.With temperatures that often reach 50+ degrees, it’s easy to see why.  This is a surreal piece of real estate that’s strewn with active volcanoes, salted basins, hot springs, and a lava lake – all of which combine to create a very lunar-like landscape.Sitting below sea level, it’s the lowest point in Africa and second in the world (after the Dead Sea).Do a bit of planning before you go as the climate can be harsh if you aren’t prepared.  But the beauty and mystery of this place make any preparation well worth it.</p>

                    <h><br><b>LALIBELA</b></h>
                    <p>Lalibela (Amharic: ላሊበላ) is a town in Amhara Region, Ethiopia famous for its rock-cut monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large antiquity of the medieval and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia.[1] Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Axum, and a center of pilgrimage. Unlike Axum, the population of Lalibela is almost completely Ethiopian Orthodox Christian.Ethiopia was one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the 4th century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. The churches themselves date from the 7th to 13th centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. ca. 1181–1221). </p>
